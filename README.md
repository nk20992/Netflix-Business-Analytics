# Netflix-Business-Analytics
This project presents ten business analytics problems solved using SQL on Netflix content data. The queries explore key insights such as the comparison between movies and TV shows, the most common ratings, movies released in specific years, and the top countries producing Netflix content. They also identify the longest movies, analyze recent content additions, and list series with more than five seasons. Further analysis includes genre-based counts, detection of documentaries, and identifying entries missing director information. Together, these queries demonstrate SQL techniques in aggregation, filtering, ranking, and exploratory data analysis for media intelligence.
